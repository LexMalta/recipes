tags: japanese, dessert
original: https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-anko-red-bean-paste/

ingredients:
- (Measurements for 300g / 900g of anko)
- 200g / 600g red beans
- water
- 100g / 300g sugar
- pinch / 1/8 tsp salt
- 20g / 60g glucose syrup

directions:
- Rinse azuki beans and drain water. (See note 1.)
- Transfer the beans to a large pot and enough water to cover them by 1–2 inches.
- Place the pot on the stove and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.
- Once boiling, drain the beans in a fine-mesh sieve. Return the beans to the same pot.
- Add more water to the pot to cover the beans by 1–2 inches.
- "Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, put an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top of the beans. Reduce the heat to medium low and keep it simmering for the next 1–1½ hours. Tip: The otoshibuta will prevent the beans from dancing around too much. (See note 2.)"
- Some of the liquid will evaporate, so add more water to keep the beans covered, as needed. After 1 hour, check if the beans are cooked. Pick up a bean and mash it with your fingers. When it mashes easily, it‘s done.
- Drain the cooked azuki beans in a sieve.
- Return the beans to the same pot. Turn the heat to medium low and add half of the sugar.
- Mix well. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the rest of the sugar.
- Mix well, stirring constantly. Then, add 0.5 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and stir.
- If you plan to use the red beans for Zenzai (Oshiruko), you can use it right away. If you prefer a thicker version, reduce the soup further.
- Let the moisture evaporate. When you can draw a line on the bottom of the pot with your spatula, turn off the heat. Don‘t worry if the anko is still loose; it will continue to thicken as it cools. (See note 3.)
- If you want tsubuan (chunky paste) stop here. If you want koshian (smooth paste), use an immersion blender to blend the beans to a smooth paste. (See note 4.)
- "Transfer the anko to an airtight container, cool, and store in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months. You can also divide and wrap 100 g portions in plastic film and store in a freezer bag. When you’re ready to use it, defrost it in the refrigerator overnight. Tip: Compared to store-bought red bean paste, homemade anko uses less sugar and therefore doesn‘t keep as long."

notes:
- She says to remove broken beans, but I never do and the paste seems fine.
- I also don't use the drop lid and it seems f ine.
- She says to transfer to a baking tray to cool, but I don't bother with that either.
- She blends them before returning to the pot and adding sugar, but I find it easier to blend at the end.
