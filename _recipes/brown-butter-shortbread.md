tags: cookie, dessert
original: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/biscuits-ted-lasso

ingredients:
- 140g unsalted butter _very soft + more for greasing_
- 1-2 tablespoons demerara sugar _(see note 2)_
- 56g browned butter _soft_
- 2g salt _(see note 3)_
- 140g toasted sugar
- 270g plain flour
- 57g cornstarch

directions:
- Brush a 6 x 10 (1/8 sheet) rimmed baking sheet with a light coating of soft butter. Add 1-2 tablespoons of demerara sugar and tilt the pan until it is well coated. _(see note 2)_
- Preheat the oven to 300 Â°F.
- Combine butter, browned, butter, salt, and toasted sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix well for 2-3 minutes.
- Meanwhile, combine the flour and cornstarch in a bowl. Whisk well to combine.
- Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and gently press it into the sides and corners of the tray.

notes:
- The original recipe uses a 15cm x 20cm (6in x 8in ) tin.
- The original recipe coats the pan with 1-2 tablespoonts of demerara sugar, but I found it made it too sweet for my tastes, so I skip that step
- The original recipe says to use 3/4 teaspoons of kosher salt, but I don't like the big grains of salt, as it makes some bites too salty. I like my salt more evenly distributed.
- You cannot substitute custard powder for the cornstarch. It smells delicious, but is so very, very dry.
- You don't need to use a stand mixer. I mixed it by hand and it turned out well. Just takes more effort, and makes it more important that you have soft butter.
