ingredients:
  Buns:
    - 3 cups (400 g/14 oz) plain flour
    - 1/4 cup (50 g/1.7 oz) white sugar
    - 1 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom _(see note 1)_
    - 2 1/4 teaspoons (7 g/0.25 oz) instant yeast
    - 1 cup (240 ml) milk, _lukewarm_
    - 1/4 cup (56 g) unsalted butter, _melted and slightly cooled_
    - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  Filling:
    - 1/3 cup (75 g) unsalted butter, _at room temperature_
    - 1/3 cup (65 g) light brown/granulated sugar
    - 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
  Toppings:
    - 1 beaten egg, for egg wash _(See note 2)_
    - Pearl sugar, chopped almonds, or granulated sugar, _to sprinkle on top, optional_
  Glaze (ptional):
    - 30g golden syrup
    - 30g water

directions:
- Mix milk and yeast in a small bowl and allow the yeast to activate.
- Place flour, sugar, and cardamom in the bowl of a standing mixer and mix until combined. Attach dough hook to the mixer. Add milky yeast and melted butter to the flour mixture and mix on low speed until dough comes together, 2-3 minutes.
- Add salt and continue mixing for another 8 minutes on low-medium speed until dough is soft and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
- Place dough in a large bowl brushed with oil, and toss to coat (the fat will keep the dough from drying out). Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place or on the counter for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size. Keep in mind that rising will be slower in cold weather.
- To make the filling, in a small bowl, combine soft butter, sugar, and cinnamon until you have a smooth paste.
- Shape the dough (see note 3). On a lightly floured surface or non-stick silicone baking mat, roll dough out into 35x35cm (14x14-inch) square. Spread butter-sugar mixture onto entire surface, making a very thin layer. Fold dough into thirds like a business letter, then roll again into a rough 35x20cm (14x8-inch) rectangle.
- Facing the long edge, cut dough into roughly 1.5cm wide and 20cm long strips. Twist each strip several times, slightly stretching it as you do so. Grab one end of the twisted strip and coil the dough around your hand twice, then over the top. Coil dough again and tuck the loose end in at the bottom.
- Arrange buns on a baking sheet lined with baking paper (if theyâ€™re too crowded, use 2 pans), keeping as much space between them as possible. Cover and let rest for 45-60 minutes or until doubled in size.
- Meanwhile, set the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350F/180C.
- Brush buns with an egg wash (if using), and bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.
- While buns are baking, prepare the glaze (if using). Put the golden syrup and water in a small saucepan and heat over medium-high heat until combined. It'll be watery, you just want it to be complete mixed together. Once the buns are out of the oven, brush with the glaze and top with pearl sugar.Gently transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
- Serve warm or at room temperature.
- Buns are best the same day they are made, but can be frozen for up to 2 months and reheated in the oven before serving.

notes:
- Non-fresh ground cardamom also works.
- You don't need the egg wash if you don't care about it being perfectly brown all over
- See [https://photos.app.goo.gl/m3YUYLdT1EHeNigb9](https://photos.app.goo.gl/m3YUYLdT1EHeNigb9) and [https://photos.app.goo.gl/DiTqytbF1weHTtX48](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DiTqytbF1weHTtX48) for help shaping the dough.
- The glaze is also optional. It does give the buns a pretty shine, and makes it sweeter overall, but if you need to cut down on sugar, it can be left out.
- This can be made vegan by replacing the milk with a plant-based milk, the butter with Nuttelex buttery or other vegan butter, and the egg wash omitted.
