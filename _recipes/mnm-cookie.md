ingredients:
- 125g (4oz) butter
- ½ cup (113g) sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar (103g)
- ½ teaspoon vanilla
- 1 egg, _lightly beaten_
- 1 3/4 (270g) cups self-raising flour 270g (3 tsp baking powder if using plain flour)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 125g (4oz) M&Ms, _(see note 1)_
- 60g (2oz) walnut pieces, _chopped_ _optional_ _(see note 2)_

directions:
- Preheat oven to 170°C.
- Sift together flour and salt.
- Cream together butter, sugars and vanilla.
- Add egg gradually, beating well after each addition.
- Mix in sifted flour and salt.
- Add chocolate chips and walnuts, mix well.
- Shape mixture into golf ball sized balls, place on oven tray with baking paper, allow room for spreading. _(see notes 3 and 4)_
- Bake in the oven for 20 minutes. They're done when they are a light golden brown.

notes:
- I prefer using regular M&Ms, but M&M minis also work (and peanut M&Ms could work, but I've never tried).
- If not using walnuts, substitute an equal weight of M&Ms.
- The original recipe makes them into small balls (using teaspoons), and makes 34 cookies! I'm a huge glutton and can only get 12 cookies out of this recipe.
- You can make smaller cookies. Using teaspoons, you can divide the dough into 34 small cookies and bake at 180°C for 13 minutes. Or 31 crisp / hard cookies the size of 2/3 of a golf ball which need to be baked at 170°C for 18 minutes.
