ingredients:
- 4 tablespoons (60g) water _(see note 1)_
- 2 tablespoons (28g) golden flax meal
- 1 3/4 (300g) cups plain flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 7 tablespoons (45g) cocoa powder
- 116g (4 ounces) dark chocolate, _chopped into 1/2cm pieces_ _(see note 2)_
- 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder _(optional)_ _(see note 3)_
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup (60g) water, _boiling_
- 1 1/2 cups (310g) white sugar
- 6 tablespoons (80g) vegan butter or non-hydrogenated stick margarine, _melted_ _(see note 4)_
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup walnuts, _chopped_ _(optional)_

directions:
- In a small mixing bowl whisk together the water (the not boiling one) and flax meal. Let it sit for about 10 minutes so the mixture gets goopy. Ensure your oven rack is in the middle rack position. Preheat your oven to 350F (175C). Line an 8 x 8 inch (20 x 20cm) baking dish with baking paper allowing excess baking paper on opposite sides so you can pull the brownies out of the baking dish later.
- In a medium mixing bowl whisk together the plain flour and baking soda. Set aside.
- In another medium mixing bowl add the cocoa powder, dark chocolate, espresso powder and salt. Add the boiling water and using a spoon, mix in the ingredients into a paste, making sure that all of the chocolate pieces are melted. Add the sugar, Vegan Butter, vanilla extract, flax meal mixture from Step 1 into the chocolate mixture and mix with an electric mixer until smooth (or you can just stir with a wooden spoon if you don't want to clean a mixer).
-  Stir in the walnuts if you're using them. Using a spoon, mix in the flour until well combined. The mixture will become extremely thick and you may need to use your hands to mix. Refrain from mixing this dough with an electric mixer at this point; this will overwork the dough and activate too much gluten, negatively affecting the texture of the brownies.
- Transfer the batter to the baking dish. You may need to use your fingers or a spatula to press the thick dough into place.
- Bake for 25 minutes on your oven's middle rack. Transfer the baking dish to a wire cooling rack and allow it to cool for about an hour.
- Transfer the brownies to a cooling rack by lifting them out of the baking dish by taking hold of the exposed parchment paper on each side. Allow them to cool completely before slicing into squares. I usually cut them into 16 or 25 squares, depending on how gluttonous I'm feeling.

notes:
- The original recipe uses 3 tablespoons (45g), but I find it's a bit too dry, so I use 4.
- I use Callebaut 54.5% dark chocolate chips (because I'm too lazy to chop the chocolate and they're cheap at Costco).
- A lot of recipes seem to use coffee to enhance the flavour, but we never have instant coffee around, and I think they taste great without it
- I use Nuttelex Buttery. The original recipe says not to use tub margarine, and I don't know if Nuttelex is margarine, but it seems to work in the recipe. If using Nuttelex, it works melted or unmelted, so be as lazy as you want!
