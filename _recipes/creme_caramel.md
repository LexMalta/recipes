original: Pâtisserie à la Carte class in Paris

ingredients:
  custard:
    - 750ml milk
    - 3 eggs
    - 3 egg yolks
    - 115g sugar
    - 1 vanilla bean, _split lengthwise_, or 1 tsp vanilla bean paste, or 1 tsp vanilla extract
  caramel:
    - 300g sugar
    - 100g water

directions:
- Preheat oven to 160°C (325°F).
- Put the water and sugar for the caramel in a small saucepan. Bring to 155°C (311°F). _See note 1_.
- Put the saucepan into a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking and prevent the sugar from colouring and becoming hard. _See note 2_.
- Line the molds or individual ramekins with the caramel by pouring enough in the bottom to cover half the surface.
- Quickly rotate the ramekin so that the entire bottom surface is evenly covered with caramel. Let cool.
- Combine the milk, sugar and vanilla bean / paste (if using) in a large saucepan (_see note 3_) and bring to boil.
- Stir the mixture continously to help dissolve the sugar.
- Beat eggs and yolks rapidly in a large bowl.
- Pour the boiling milk over the beaten eggs. Do not add the milk too quickly at first, or the eggs could coagulate.
- Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve.
- Add vanilla extract to the mixture now, if using.
- Pour the mixture into the caramel-lined molds or ramekins. Fill to 1cm (1/2in) below the rim. Cover with a square of aluminium foil.
- Prepare a bain-marie (water bath) by getting a baking tray with high walls (like a brownie tray). Make sure the bain-marie is lined with paper to prevent the water from splashing. The paper lining protects the crème caramel from the direct heat of the oven.
- Place the molds / ramekins into the tray and fill with boiling water until halfway up the sides of the molds. Slide into the oven carefully to avoid water getting onto the molds.
- Bake in the oven with vents open, or door ajar, if possible for 25 - 45 minutes, depending on the size of the molds. _See note 4_.
- Check regularly to make sure the crème are not colouring too rapidly and the bain-marie water isn't boiling.
- To verify that they're done, the surface of the crème should tremble slightly when jiggled. A knife inserted into the center should remain clean when pulled out.
- Once they're done, remove from the molds from the bain-marie and place them on cooling racks. They may also be put directly on crushed ice if they need to be cooled quickly.
- To serve, run a knife around the edge, then turn the mold upside down onto a plate. Tap the bottom of the mold gently. I'm told it helps to say, "Just like a sandcastle".

notes:
- According to the teacher, don't stir the caramel, as it causes the sugar to crystalise on the spoon. If your saucepan has a hot spot, swirl the pan around to mix the caramel and avoid parts of it burning. You can cook the caramel to your desired level of burnt. I prefer a lighter caramel.
- I actually don't do this due to laziness. I just stop cooking it a little before my desired done-ness.
- I like to use a wide saute pan, as the larger surface area makes it easier to keep the mixture consistent in temperature. It also has a heavy base to avoid it changing temperature too quickly.
- I've done it without the door ajar and it works fine.
