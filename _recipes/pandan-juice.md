original: hhttps://whattocooktoday.com/how-to-make-pandan-juice-and-pandan-extract.html

ingredients:
- 5 pandan leaves _(see note 2)_
- 120ml water

directions:
- Wash the leaves to get rid of sand / dirt.
- Cut the leaves into 3cm pieces.
- Put the leaves and the water in a blender and blend until the leaves turn into pulp.
- Pour the mixture through a strainer, into a container. Use a spoon to try and squeeze as much liquid out as you can.

notes:
- You will need a blender and a fine mesh strainer. You can use a cheesecloth instead of a strainer, but I can't be bothered cleaning the juices off it, so I just use a strainer.
- The best pandan leaves to use are mature, but not old. They should have a dark green colour.
- Works with fresh or frozen leaves (you don't need to defrost it, and the washing step will wash any ice off)
- Can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 week.
