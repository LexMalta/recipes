ingredients:
- 4 egg yolks
- 1 1/2 tsp vanilla paste (see Note 1)
- 110g white sugar
- 83g custard powder (see Note 2)
- 550g whole milk
- 27g unsalted butter, _at room temperature_

# for nested ingredients you can go like this:
# ingredients:
#  Dry:
#    - 120g plain flour
#    - 12g cocoa powder
#  Wet:
#    - 10ml water

directions:
- Put yolks in a medium bowl and whisk. (see Note 3)
- Add the vanilla paste and whisk.
- Add the sugar and whisk for a few minutes, until the mixture drops from the whisk in ribbons.
- Add the custard powder and whisk for 30 seconds.
- In a large saucepan, heat the milk over medium-low heat, until just before boiling. (See Note 4.)
- Take milk off the heat and whisk a small amount into the egg mixture. Pour the rest of the milk into the egg mixture and continue whisking.
- Transfer the custard back into the saucepan and heat over medium heat, whisking constantly.
- The cream is done when it has thickened to your desired consistency. I like to do it until the whisk starts to leave a trail that doesn't immediately sink back into the mixture. (See Note 5.)
- Transfer to a bowl and continue whisking for a minute while it cools. Add the butter and continue whisking until it's mixed in.
- Cover with plastic wrap, making sure the wrap touches the cream to avoid a skin forming on the top.
- Refrigerate for at least an hour, preferrably overnight.
- When ready to use, take it out of the fridge and give it a small stir to make it creamy and smooth again.
- This lasts up to 4 days in the fridge.

notes:
- The book uses half a vanilla bean, but I find that's not enough vanilla and I can't be bothered with beans even though I'm sure it'll taste better.
- They recommend using custard powder for a richer cream with a brighter colour, but the book says you can substitute with plain flour instead.
- You can do this in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment.
- I don't quite follow the method in the book, I prefer the heat milk first and add milk to eggs, then back into the pan method to the one in the book. In the book, the milk is added to the eggs before heating. The entire mixture is added to the pan and slowly heated to thicken. That's probably easier and I don't know why I do it the other way.
- You're supposed to strain it through a strainer at this point, but I am too lazy, and I've never had any lumps. One less thing to wash.
