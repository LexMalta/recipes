ingredients:
- 500g white sugar _(see note 1)_

notes:
- Works for any amount, but since it takes so long irrespective of how much you use, you might as well make a bunch at once. I usually do as much sugar as I can fit in the tray and save the rest in an air-tight container for next time.

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 150C / 300F
- Spread the sugar out onto a baking tray
- Bake in the oven, stirring every 15-20 minutes until a light golden brown. 1-2 hours for lightly toasted sugar, can go up to 6 hours for really golden, but be careful if it start to look damp, as it'll start liquefying soon and you don't want that.
- Allow to cool for at least an hour before using.
- If it clumps up while cooling you can break it up with a spoon, or put it in a blender / food processor.

Sugar that's less sweet than white sugar, with a caramel flavour. Can be used in place of white sugar in a 1:1 ratio.
