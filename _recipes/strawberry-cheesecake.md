# for nested ingredients you can go like this:
# ingredients:
#  Dry:
#    - 120g plain flour
#    - 12g cocoa powder
#  Wet:
#    - 10ml water

directions:
- Preheat oven to 160C/320F (standard) or 140C/295F (fan/convection).
- Get a 23cm/9" springform cake tin. Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN (note 6), butter lightly and place a square piece of parchment/baking paper on the base. Then clip into the springform pan – excess paper will stick out, see photos in post and video.
- Butter and line the side of the pan.
- Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor.
- Blitz until fine crumbs (note 3). Add butter, briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand.
- Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls.
- Use something with a flat base and vertical edges (I used a glass) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.
- Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until just smooth, no longer than 20 seconds on speed 4. (You do not want to aerate cheesecake filling as it causes cracks when it bakes)
- Add flour, beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 until just incorporated.
- Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 sec max, speed 5).
- Add eggs one at a time, beat in between until just combined (5 sec each), and after the last one, beat just until the egg is fully incorporated.
- Pour into prepared crust.
- Place the cake on a tray (or butter will drip out). Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan. The cake will rise while baking, but it'll sink again after it cools.
- Cool the cake in the oven with the door open 20 cm / 8″ (Note 7), then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan.
- Remove sides. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper.
- Place chopped strawberries, vanilla, sugar and lemon juices in a saucepan. Stir then bring to simmer over medium heat.
- Simmer for 10 minutes until strawberries breakdown.
- Mix cornflour with water, then add into saucepan and stir.
- Add halved strawberries and cook for 1 minute to soften.
- Sauce should be syrupy – remove from stove and cool. Will thicken as it cools.
- Once cool, stirl. Adjust thickness to make it the right “oozing” consistency (see video, Note 8) with a tiny touch of water (be careful!).
- Spoon onto cheesecake so it’s covered with a single layer of strawberries. Flip strawberry halves so they are facedown. Refrigerate 2 hours+.
- Slice and serve with remaining Strawberry Sauce!

notes:
- This has been adapted to fit a 9 inch cake pan. Check the OG recipe for an 8 inch pan.
- "Biscuits - I used malt o' milks. Any plain crackers will work fine here, you need 2 cups of crumbs. Australia: Arnott’s Marie Crackers, Arrowroot and Nice are ideal, I’ve made it with all these. US: Use 28 squares / 14 full sheets, yes I measured it with my last Graham Cracker packet I brought back from my last trip. UK: Digestives are ideal, I LOVE digestives! The crumb should be like wet sand so when pressed, it stays packed firmly, especially up the wall. It’s delicate when uncooked but once the filling is cooked, it becomes much more stable."
- "Crumbs: OR crush in a ziplock bag using a rolling pin or large can. Don't use a blender, the crumbs will be too fine."
- Cream Cheese – In the UK and some parts of Europe, block cream cheese isn’t available. If you can only get spreadable cream cheese in tubs (softer than block), skip the sour cream.
- Lemon Juice or Water – Depends on sweetness of strawberries. If they aren’t that sweet, use water instead.
- "Inverted cake pan with overhang paper: The base of springform pans have a slight ridge. By inverting it, there is no ridge which makes it easier to slide the cheesecake on a serving platter without ruining the crust. There is no risk of batter leakage as the crust is thick enough to hold it all in."
- "Cool in oven: This helps stop the surface from cracking."
- Strawberry topping should be like jam consistency, not a set jelly. It should ooze slightly when cut.
- "Different measures: Cups and spoons vary slightly between countries (US and CAN are different to most of the rest of the world). I have made this recipe using both US and Australian measures, using Australia Marie crackers and US Graham Crackers. The Graham Cracker crust is slightly crunchier because the biscuit doesn’t crush to a fine sand like Marie Crackers do. Both are delicious!"
- 'Make Ahead / Storage: Cake is at its best consumed within 4 days, after that I feel like it starts getting denser but still really fab, most people wouldn’t notice a difference! Ideal to top the day or or day before. After 2 to 3 days, the top does start to "sweat" but it’s not very noticeable.'
