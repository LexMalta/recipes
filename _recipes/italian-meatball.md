tags: lunch, dinner
original: https://www.wineandglue.com/the-best-italian-meatballs/

ingredients:
- 500g beef mince
- 500g pork mince, _(see note 1)_
- 2 eggs, _whisked_ _(see note 2)_
- 4 slices of Italian bread 5 ounces (141g), crusts removed _(see note 3)_
- 1 cup (115g) bread crumbs
- 4 tablespoons grated parmesan, _optional_
- 1/2 tsp garlic salt, or powdered garlic
- 1 tsp salt
- pinch of black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, _optional_

directions:
- Preheat oven to 190 °C / 375 °F.
- Soak the bread in cold water for about five minutes, ringing out the excess water and pulling the bread apart with your fingers.
- Combine the meat, eggs, and parsley in a large bowl. Add the bread. Then add the dry bread crumbs, parmesan, garlic salt, and salt.
- Using a cookie scoop scoop out the meatballs onto wax paper and then roll them into into consistent balls. Place them on a cookie cooling rack. Place that rack on a baking sheet. _(See note 5)_
- Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until you can cut into a meatball in the middle of the rack and not see pink.

notes:
- The original recipe uses a 2:1 ratio of beef:pork, but 1:1 still works.
- You can skip the egg. They'll be a bit drier, but if you can't have egg, then it's better to have slightly dry meatballs than no meatballs!
- I use the Coles ciabatta. The crust ends up being a bit tough in the meatball, so I remove them.
- While you can pan fry these meatballs, it's much easier and faster to bake them in the oven.
- You can just use a spoon to scoop the meat and roll them with your hands. Saves you washing meat out of a cookie scoop. We place the meatballs directly onto a rack and they're probably not as nice as baking them on a cookie cooling rack, but again, less effort while cleaning up.
