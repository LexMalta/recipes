ingredients:
    Meat:
        - 1kg pork neck, _wash and drain the meat_
        - 1 cup sugar, _to dry and tenderize the meat_
    Sauce:
        - 2 cloves of garlic, _finely chopped, grated in a microplane, or pressed in a garlic press_
        - 2 shallots, _(see note 1)_
        - 6 tablespoons of soy sauce
        - 2 teaspoons of salt
        - 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five spice
        - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
        - 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
        - 2 tablespoons Mei Kuei Lu Chiew cooking wine
        - 2 tablespoons ground bean sauce
        - 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
        - 1 tablespoon sesame sauce
        - 1/2 tablespoon ginger finely grated, or pressed in a garlic press
    - Glaze:
        - 4 tablespoons of honey or maltose
        - 1/4 cup boiling water
        - 4 tablespoons of sugar

directions:
- Mix together the pork neck and sugar. Leave it in the fridge to marinate for at least an hour. This should extract excess water from the meat.
- Meanwhile, mix together all the sauce ingredients.
- Take the meat out of the fridge and drain the excess water.
- Pour the sauce in with the meat and mix to coat the meat with the sauce. Leave to marinate overnight if possible, otherwise for at least 2 hours.
- Preheat oven to  220Â°C.
- Start making the glaze. Put the honey / maltose and sugar in a small heatproof bowl. Fill a larger bowl with the boiling water and put the small bowl inside it. Stir the mixture until it becomes like a syrup.
- Put the pork on a wire rack and use the glaze to coat the pork (you'll do multiple coatings, so you should have more leftover).
- Leave another roasting tray or something with a rim at the bottom of the oven to catch the drippings. Half fill the catching tray with water (both to make it easier to clean later, and to add some steam).
- Put the pork in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.
- Turn the pork over and glaze again.
- Repeat the glazing and turning every 20 minutes until you run out of glaze.
- Remove from the oven.

notes:
- It's important not to substitute the shallots with other onions, as the shallots give it the red colour.
