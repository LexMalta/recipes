ingredients:
- 3/4 tsp (1g) instant yeast
- 1/4 cup (60ml) water, _lukewarm (~33Â°C)_
- 1 1/2 cups (72g + 144g) plain flour, _(you'll need to add half a cup at first, then the rest later, that's why it's split)_
- 2 eggs, _(see note 1)_
- 2 tbsp (32g) light brown sugar, _(see note 2)_
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 2 tsp vanilla extract / paste
- 2 tsp (16g) honey, _(see note 3)_
- 11 tbsp (165g) butter, _room temp_ _(see note 4)_
- 3/4 cup Belgian pearl sugar _(see note 5)_

directions:
- In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Allow to stand for 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of flour (72g) and one egg. Mix to combine.
- Cover with remaining flour and leave to stand for 60 minutes. The yeast mixture should bubble through.
- Add the other egg, brown sugar, salt, vanilla and honey. Knead the dough or stir with a stiff wooden spoon until it's uniformly mixed, and a bit stretchy ~15 minutes. Or you can use a stand mixer's paddle attachment or dough hook for about the same time.
- Add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue kneading / mixing until the butter is evenly distributed.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave to rise for 4 hours.
- Put the dough in the fridge to rest overnight.
- If using Belgian pearl sugar, mix in the sugar.
- Divide the dough into 8 / 10 / 12 (depending on how big you want them) portions, and roll in white sugar if you aren't using Belgian sugar (see note 5). Leave to rise for 90 minutes.
- Prepare in your waffle maker, according to instructions.

notes:
- You can use "Flax eggs" or "chia seed eggs" in place of the eggs in this recipe, if you want to make it egg-free / vegan.
- Dark brown sugar also works in place of the light brown sugar, if that's all you have.
- Can replace the honey with maple syrup, if you can't have honey. Not sure of the weight equivalent though, as I haven't weighed 2 tablespoons of maple syrup.
- Can replace the butter with Nuttelex buttery, weight for weight.
- If you don't have Belgian pearl sugar, you can crush sugar cubes inside a ziplock bag to make makeshift pearl sugar. Otherwise, keep 120g white sugar in a bowl and coat the waffle balls before placing in the waffle maker.
