ingredients:
- ¾ cup (185ml) caster (superfine) sugar 150g
- 1½ cups (375ml) water
- 1.4kg seedless watermelon, _chopped_
- ¼ cup (60ml) lemon juice

directions:
- Place the sugar and water in a saucepan and stir over low heat until dissolved. Set aside to cool.
- Juice the watermelon in an electric juicer to get 1 litre of juice. Combine with the sugar syrup and lemon juice and pour into a flat metal container (see note 1).
- Place in the freezer. After 2 hours, whisk with a fork and return to the freezer. Stir to break up the ice crystals at 1-hour intervals until the granita is light and easy to scoop (see note 2). Serves 4–6.

notes:
- It’s important to freeze the granita in a metal tray because the metal keeps the mixture colder and at the right consistency.
- Breaking up the granita at intervals during the freezing time separates the ice crystals before they are fully set.
