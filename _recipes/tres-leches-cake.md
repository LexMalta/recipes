ingredients:
  Cake:
    - 6 large eggs, separated, at room temperature
    - 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar, or 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
    - 250g white sugar, _see Note 2_
    - 1/3 cup (74g) water, cold
    - 2 tsp vanilla extract
    - 1 tsp almond extract, _optional, (see Note 3)_
    - 2 teaspoons baking powder
    - 1/2 tsp salt
    - 1 1/2 cups (180g) plain flour
  Topping:
    - 1/2 cup (113g) thickened cream (heavy cream)
    - 1 can (400g) sweetened condensed milk
    - 1 can (340g) evaporated milk
    - 1 tsp vanilla extract or 1 tbsp brandy / light rum


# for nested ingredients you can go like this:
# ingredients:
#  Dry:
#    - 120g plain flour
#    - 12g cocoa powder
#  Wet:
#    - 10ml water

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F). Lightly grease a 23cm x 33cm x 5cm (9" x 13" x 2") pan, _(see Note 4)_; line it with baking paper and grease the paper, if you plan on turning the cake out onto a serving platter. Alternatively, you can serve the cake from in the pan.
- "To make the cake: Combine the egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl, and beat the whites until soft peaks form. Set them aside."
- In another large bowl, beat the egg yolks until well combined. Add the sugar, and beat until the mixture comes together and thickens. When you stop beating, the mixture should fall from the beater(s) in ribbons as you lift them out of the bowl.
- Add the water and vanilla and almond extracts to the egg yolk mixture, beating to combine.
- Stir in the baking powder, salt, and flour, beating just to combine.
- Gently and thoroughly fold in the beaten egg whites, stirring until no streaks of white show.
- Scoop the batter into the prepared pan, gently smoothing the top.
- Bake the cake for 28 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove it from the oven, and set it on a rack. Loosen the edges with a spatula or table knife.
- After 20 minutes, gently turn the cake out onto a serving platter, turning it upright, if desired. You can also leave it face-down if you like; you'll be topping it with whipped cream, so any imperfections on the bottom crust will be hidden. You may also choose to serve the cake right from the pan; in which case, leave it where it is.
- Allow the cake to cool to room temperature.
- "To make the topping: Combine the 1/2 cup cream, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla or liquor, stirring thoroughly."
- Poke the cake all over with a fork. Pour the milk mixture over the cake slowly, stopping occasionally to allow it to soak in. This seems like a lot of liquid for the cake to absorb; but don't worry, it will.
- Cover the cake and refrigerate it for several hours before serving.
- "Storage information: Refrigerate any leftover cake for up to several days."

notes:
- The original recipe includes frosting, but I don't think it needs it. If you want to add it, it's 1 1/2 cups (340g) thickened cream and 1/4 cup (50g) white sugar. Whip together until stiff enough to spread. Spread it on top of the cake and dust with cinnamon if you want. Do this just before serving.
- I reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe as the cake was already pretty sweet.
- If you leave out the almond extract, add an extra tsp of vanilla extract
- Your pan must be at least 5cm (2") deep; this is a high-rising cake.
