ingredients:
- 4 large eggs, _at room temperature_
- 80g caster or superfine sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 100g caster or superfine sugar
- 70ml (56.5g) oil
- 50ml / 1.7floz fresh pandan juice made from 5 leaves OR 1 teaspoon pandan paste, _(see note 2)_
- 50ml / 1.7floz (58g) coconut milk
- 150g cake flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- pinch salt

directions:
- Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F. Have a chiffon tin ready but do not grease or line it.
- Separate the eggs making sure that there is no yolk in the whites. Beat the whites in a large bowl with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Then slowly add in the 80g of caster sugar until you get stiff peaks.
- Then in another bowl whisk the yolks and 100g of caster sugar until pale. Whisk in the oil and combine, then add the pandan juice (or paste if using) and coconut milk.
- Sieve in the cake flour, baking powder and salt.
- Add the yolk mixture into the whites and fold making sure that there are no streaks of colour and that the mixture is uniform in colour.
- Pour the batter into the tin and gently tap it against the countertop to remove any large air bubbles. Bake for 45 minutes.
- Cool in the tin completely (I don't tip it upside down but others do but I find the cake is too delicate to do this).
- Using a butter knife or a long, thin knife gently separate the cake from the tin making sure to get all of the sides. I usually let it sit overnight or for a few hours because when it is first cooked as it is very delicate.

notes:
- You will also need a 20cm / 8inch chiffon cake tin (do not use a non stick tin)
- I recommend making the pandan juice as it gives a nicer flavour than the bottled pandan essence that you can buy.
