original: https://www.recipesfromitaly.com/bechamel-sauce-basic-white-sauce/

ingredients:
- 500ml (2 cups) milk
- 50g unsalted butter
- 50g plain flour
- 1/4 tsp salt, _optional_
- freshly grated nutmeg, _optional_


# for nested ingredients you can go like this:
# ingredients:
#  Dry:
#    - 120g plain flour
#    - 12g cocoa powder
#  Wet:
#    - 10ml water

directions:
- Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.
- Add the flour. You can use a flour sieve, but I don't bother.
- Mix quickly with a whisk until it's smooth and there are no lumps.
- Cook for an extra 30-60 seconds until it turns a golden colour.
- Add the milk, 1 cup at a time, whisking until incorporated. _(See note 3)_
- Keep whisking until you have a thick, smooth sauce. It should coat the back of a spoon.
- Whisk in salt and nutmeg, if using.

notes:
- The flour and the butter must always have the same weight.
- I don't usually add the salt  or nutmeg when using for lasagne.
- The original recipe says to heat the milk and then pour it into the roux, but I don't want to get another pot dirty, so I just add it cold and let it heat up in the saucepan with the butter/flour roux.
