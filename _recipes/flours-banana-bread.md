tags: cake, dessert
original: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/flours-famous-banana-bread-recipe-2015076

ingredients:
- 1 2/3 cups (210g) plain flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (240g) white sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup (60g) oil, _(see note 1)_
- 3 1/2 bananas, _very ripe, mashed_
- 70g yoghurt, _(plain or vanilla)_, _(see note 2)_
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2/3 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped, _optional_

directions:
- Set oven to 180 °C (350 °F). Line the bottom of a loaf pan with parchment paper.
- Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.
- Beat sugar and eggs with a whisk until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes.
- Drizzle in oil. Add mashed bananas, yoghurt, and vanilla.
- Fold in dry ingredients and nuts, if using.
- Pour into a lined loaf pan and bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour

notes:
- The original recipe uses 1/2 cup of oil, but I think it makes it too greasy.
- The origianl recipe uses 2 tablespoons creme fraiche or sour cream, but we never have that stuff in the house and I don't want to buy a tub of it just to use 2 tablespoons, so I use yoghurt instead.
- The eggs can be substituted with "chia seed eggs" or "flaxseed eggs", to make it vegan.
