title: "Browned Butter"

original: https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-brown-butter-technique

ingredients:
- butter
- 1 ice cube for every ~110g of butter

notes:
- Cook over a lower heat at first, until you get the hang of knowing when it's done.
- The process of browning the butter cooks off some water, but adding the ice cube at the end not only cools the butter so stops cooking, but also adds some of that missing water back.
- Sometimes I'm lazy and don't add the ice cube and it's been fine so far... It is supposed to be drier than regular butter, hence the extra water needed.

directions:
- Add the butter to a small saucepan.
- Melt over medium-high heat. 
- Once the butter is completely liquid and begins to bubble, reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking until the milk solids turn brown. Make sure the stir the butter periodically to make sure you donâ€™t burn the solids. It'll start making popping sounds.
- When it starts to foam and you see dark brown flecks in the butter, you can stop. Or wait a bit longer for a darker browned butter with a stronger nutty taste. If you can't hear anymore pops, take it off the heat, it's definitely done by then.
- Transfer the browned butter to a heat safe vessel and allow to cool. Add 1 ice cube to prevent the solids from browning any further.

Browned butter has a nuttier flavour than regular butter. If you added the ice cube in, you can use it in place of regular butter.
