ingredients:
- 2 cupes (500ml) whole milk
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- 3 tbsp (45g) butter, _salted or unsalted, melted_ (see Note 1)
- 1/2 cup (70g) buckwheat flour
- 3/4 cup (105g) plain flour
- 3 large eggs

# for nested ingredients you can go like this:
# ingredients:
#  Dry:
#    - 120g plain flour
#    - 12g cocoa powder
#  Wet:
#    - 10ml water

directions:
- In a blender, or with a whisk, mix together all the ingredients until smooth. Cover and chill overnight.
- To fry the crêpes, remove the batter from the refrigerator about an hour before frying. Stir it briskly; it should be the consistency of heavy cream. (If not, you can add a tablespoon of milk.)
- Heat a 8- to 9-inch skillet on the stovetop. You can use a real crêpe pan that’s been seasoned, but I use a Tefal non-stick skillet which works great.
- Drop a tiny piece of butter or neutral oil in the hot pan and wipe it around with a paper towel. (I only do this for the first crêpe.)
- Lift the pan and pour 1/4 cup (see Note 2) of the batter in the middle of the hot skillet, swirling the pan to distribute the batter quickly and evenly. The pan shouldn’t be too hot or too cold. The batter should start cooking within a few seconds, giving you just enough time to swirl it. It may take a couple of crêpes for you to get your rhythm.
- After about a minute, run a non-stick spatula around the underside of the rim of the crêpe, then flip the crepe over. I grasp the crepe with my fingers, but you’re not me (…consider yourself lucky!) and I’m not you. So use the spatula if you wish.
- Let the crêpe cook on the flip side for about 30 seconds, then slide it out onto a dinner plate. Repeat, cooking the crepes with the remaining batter, stirring the batter every so often as you go.
- Crêpes should be served warm. To rewarm the crêpes for serving, fold the crepes and put them in a baking dish covered with foil. Heat them in a moderate oven until warmed through.

notes:
- I use unsalted.
- I use 1/3 cup because I like my crêpes a bit thicker.
- Since this recipes makes 18-20 crêpes, it may be more than you need all at once. But if you’re going to stand over a hot stove, you may as well make extra and freeze them. Once cool, wrap securely in plastic film, then foil. They’ll keep in the freezer for a couple of months. You can also store them in the refrigerator for up to three days, well-wrapped.
