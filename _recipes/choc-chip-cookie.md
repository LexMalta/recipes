ingredients:
- 225g unsalted butter
- 1 standard ice cube (about 2 tablespoons; 30 mL frozen water - I skip this)
- 280g plain flour
- 3/4 teaspoon (3g) baking soda
- 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt (4g)
- 140g white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons (10 ml) vanilla extract
- 140g dark brown sugar
- 225g semisweet chocolate
- coarse sea salt, _for garnish_, _(I skip this)_

directions:
- Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently swirling pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. I skip this, but you can transfer to a medium bowl, whisk in ice cube,
- Transfer to refrigerator, and allow to cool completely, about 20 minutes. (Alternatively, whisk over an ice bath to hasten the process.)
- Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
- Place white sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium-high speed until mixture is pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about 5 minutes. Or you can use a hand mixer.
- Fit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled (it should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the edges), add brown sugar and cooled brown butter to egg mixture in stand mixer. Mix on medium speed to combine, about 15 seconds. Or just mix with a spatula / spoon.
- Add flour mixture and mix with spatula / spoon until just barely combined.
- Add chocolate and mix until evenly distributed. Roll into 2 tablespoon balls. (See note 1)
- Cover with glad wrap and refrigerate dough at least overnight and up to 3 days.
- When ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 325°F (160°C).
- Place balls of cookie dough onto baking paper-lined tray. 12 balls on each sheet. Tear each ball in half to reveal a rougher surface, then stick them back together with the rough sides facing outward. Transfer to oven and bake until golden brown around edges but still soft, 13 to 16 minutes, rotating pans back to front and top to bottom halfway through baking.
- You can garnish with salt now, but I think it makes it too salty.

notes:
- The original recipe says 3 tablespoon balls, but I think that's a bit too big.
- I bake for 13 minutes, rotating the tray at 6.5 minutes.
